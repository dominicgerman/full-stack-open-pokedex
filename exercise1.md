RuboCop is a linter/formatter for Ruby. It seems to be a popular choice and has a lot of features. RSpec seems to be the industry standard for testing in ruby apps. Ruby is an interpreted language so there is no compiling step. There is a build tool called Capistrano but it just automates steps of deploying an application.
Buddy is an alternative option for CI/CD for Ruby. It is supposed to remove the pains of configuring that plague Jenkins. It allows you to automate testing and deployment. You can also configure it to send messages to your team in Slack after each deployment. You can create pipelines for your staging and production environments and integrate with services like AWS.
It looks like Buddy is more of a self-hosting solution than a cloud based solution. It has a lot of features and seems to be geared towards large projects. It seems very customizable. Basically it seems like a way easier to use version of Jenkins. I don't really know what Jenkins offers but Buddy supports a lot of different stuff. Buddy is a web-based software though so maybe it works for cloud environments too? I don't know!

This is a test for exercise 13.
